## Scenario

Imagine you're a lending company. You need a simple system to allow your customers to request for loans, receive funds in their mobile money wallets, pay back their loans as well as receive occasional reminders about their loans.

This app does all that, with ~260 lines of code with no DBs, no queues and no complicated logic. All thanks to Elarian.


## Install and run

```sh
npm install
# edit .env and add correct values
npm start
```
